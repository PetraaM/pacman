            Pac-Man, originally called Puck Man in Japan, is a 1980 maze action video game 
            developed and released by Namco for arcades. In North America, the game 
            was released by Midway Manufacturing as part of its licensing agreement 
            with Namco America. The player controls Pac-Man, who must eat all the 
            dots inside an enclosed maze while avoiding four colored ghosts. 
            Eating large flashing dots called "Power Pellets" causes the ghosts to
            temporarily turn blue, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for bonus points.

            Game development began in early 1979, directed by Toru Iwatani with a nine-man team. 
            Iwatani wanted to create a game that could appeal to women as well as men, because 
            most video games of the time had themes of war or sports. Although the inspiration
            for the Pac-Man character was the image of a pizza with a slice removed, Iwatani has said
            he also rounded out the Japanese character for mouth, kuchi. The in-game characters were
            made to be cute and colorful to appeal to younger players. The original Japanese title 
            of Puck Man was derived from the Japanese phrase "Paku paku taberu" which refers to 
            gobbling something up; the title was changed to Pac-Man for the North American release.
            Pac-Man was a widespread critical and commercial success, leading to several sequels, 
            merchandise, and two television series, as well as a hit single by Buckner & Garcia. 
            <br><br>
            The character of Pac-Man has become the official mascot of Bandai Namco Entertainment.
            The game remains one of the highest-grossing and best-selling games, generating more than 
            $14 billion in revenue (as of 2016) and 43 million units in sales combined, and has an 
            enduring commercial and cultural legacy, commonly listed as one of the greatest video games of all time.

Project title: Pac-Man (90´s inspired web-page)
Description: this is a school project I worked on as a part of fundamentals course at Hyper Island. It was supposed to be fun and show off everything we learned within CSS & HTML, with everything else being additionional bonus. 
I wanted to do something fun, interesting but also something that evokes memories from the 90´s. That´s how Pac-man was born.
I used HTML, CSS and some JS. 
The page is supposed to be only for fun and my own practice, but there is a game at the end if you want to play.
You can see how it looks like here: ----->   https://effervescent-cuchufli-e43f8d.netlify.app/
